### Additional Information
Building this Dashboard was quite challenging, but nonetheless i was able to come up with this https://stupefied-mccarthy-0124b9.netlify.app/ 

I implemented the local search, but it displays the result in the console. Since the Api doesn't support it. it doesn't display any good information. But works flawlessly when tried with some other APIs.

Still having a lot of erros working on the paginator and testing
